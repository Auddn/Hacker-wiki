    <h2>What is Hacking?</h2>
    A security hacker is someone who explores methods for breaching defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network.<br> 
    Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, information gathering, challenge, recreation, or to evaluate system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential hackers.<br> 
    The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the "computer underground". - Wikipedia<br>
